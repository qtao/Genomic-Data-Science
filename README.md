# Genomic-Data-Science
## Genomic data science specialization

### Incentives & Benefits
High-throughput experimental techniques have enabled the Data Science revolution in modern biology. People with skills in biology, computations and statistics are fundamental to this change. This Specialization will help you be a part of the new wave of Big Data Science in Genomics. These skills are in high demand across modern biology, from bench scientists in industry and academia to data scientists working with healthcare analytics.

### Courses
This specialization will teach you to understand, analyze, and interpret data from next-generation sequencing experiments. You will learn common tools of genomic data science, including Python, R, Bioconductor, and Galaxy. These courses can serve as a stand-alone introduction to genomic data science or can compliment to a primary degree or postdoc in biology, molecular biology, or genetics. The Specialization concludes with a Capstone project that allows you to apply the skills you've learned throughout the courses.
